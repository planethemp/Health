No need for titanium clips or biopsys
	biopsys = explosion of the problem
		don't need to physically know there's a cancer cell in the tumor to assume it
		they just wanna juice you with chemo & radiation for $
			many stories from M.D.s about that, flawed system but some good doctors
			= lung cancer from the masticize of the radiation burning the lungs which is already lymphatically compromised because the same excillary lymph system is involved
consider water/grape fasting (30day) + intermittant lemon juice
	24-36hr dry fast once a week or so
	herbs for kidneys, adrenals, lymph system, to clean up bowels, other endos up & going, wake up nervous system
mono fruit / lemonade fast, juice a lot (lots of citrus), lymph/kidney formulas (heal all tea, three lung tea, GI Brew), detox book + watch morse's vids
	= 6mo later thermal scan that showed no cancer, felt great + lots of energy but lymph nodes would still swell and hurt at times + breast has a hradness to it
		means still involved lymphatically = keep going til you can have cake/icecream w/o exploding lymph nodes = shows those foods compromise the lymph system 
everything gets hard that's acidic
	= keep working til breast gets soft again
work on kidney filtration if there's hard lymph nodes
	dry fasting
	can try an oil under the arms like castor oil
	laetrile (Vitamin B17) kinda loosens up hard lymph nodes
swolen / backed up lymph can rip tissue apart
	lots of lymphatic responses called inflammation
		inflammation is the pulling of calcium
			not just interleukin is also the pulling of calcium
				Interleukin (IL), any of a group of naturally occurring proteins that mediate communication between cells. Interleukins regulate cell growth, differentiation, and motility. They are particularly important in stimulating immune responses, such as inflammation.
			can be seen in calcifications, cholesterol, and lymph issues
				if you understand acids you can see why this is
					not going grab an a minor minor when it can grab the most abundant mineral in the body and rip it apart from its matrix
						the bicarbonate of the kidneys are for the kidneys
						you've got a pancreatic duct bicarbonate
						but when thinking of bicarbonate as a systemic alkalizer that's a misconception / incorrect theory

1yr into change of lifestyle + excruciating back pain = could be caused by healing crisis
	keep back aligned/straight
		go to good chiros that align it the right way
		work with kinesiology
	could be out because of weaknesses
		this would ofc affect lymph drainage
	it will always want to pull because of the lymph system
		one kidney is always weaker than another
		it's rare to have bilaterally the same kidneys
		= that side, when you look at the eyes, will show more lymphatic problems and genetic weaknesses
	helps to explain why that exists, you experience it real in reality
		medical can't explain it because they're off chasing diseases using toxic chemistry to treat it
iridology shows why you have issues such as backpain
	can see a large lacuna showing issues in the middle of the back
	= healing crisis = can be very painful
	= any pain you felt you will feel going backwards while treating it
	= because many people eat acid forming foods = they never really heal any trauma to the body completely
	moving pain = a healing crisis
		e.g. from mid shoulder blades to kidneys
	will see where you have problems
		won't have a symptom even in a healing crisis where there's no problems
		only in your weaker / most congested areas
vegetables not good neuro rebuilders in humans
	neuropothies / neuro weakness = go to fruits berries melons. (forget the veggies)
lymph/kidney tincture # 4/5 are very strong
	they really help pull = will feel some pain from that
	if you feel you're going too fast, slow it down a bit
		especially the lymph formulas, these are the rippers
			will break open tumors, 
				Chaparrals (Larrea tridentata) + Bloodroot (Sanguinaria) +  Poke Root (Phytolacca americana)
				Violets (Viola) + Red clover + Burdock 
	if you want to stop the pain, just go back to cooked (aka low energy) foods
		foods that are devoid of nutrition/energetics = body stops healing itself
		= living food is key to life
	2 choices at this level
		either make diet more strict (grape/lemon fast)
		or stop w/ cooked food
		If you can't handle it beyond belief go to cooked
Move hard lymph out of breast + manage excruciating pain
	can take a natural aspirin
		Morse has a natural anti-spasmodic / pain killer
			try those beforestepping up to advil/aspirin
				many problems being found w/ aspirins
Keep going til symptoms are all the way gone + then some
	keep getting stronger

Stage 4 breast Cancer - tiffany 31
	2 yrs ago started juicing + went vegan right away
		slowed it down but hasn't stopped it
		= go after those kidneys
		dry fast 24-36 hrs a week
		get them filtering asap if you're stage 4
		If it slowed down that's good
			go in aggressively = you can stop that + start reversing it (getting lymph moving, reverse tumors, etc.)
	Is also in lymph nodes/bones
		always been in the lymph nodes, whether or not you have a cancer cell or not, that's the job of the macrophages in the lymph nodes
		If lymph nodes are so involved that macrophages are suppressed in that way = that's a problem
Stage 4 = must get very strict
	drop everything in life, if you wanna keep your physical body, must get into true regenerative detoxification to save yourself

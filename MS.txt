Some cases may or may not include brain lesions

detox involves taking consideration of bowels, lymph, kidneys, endocrine glands (adrenals specifically)
	think digestion, absorption, utilization, elimination = controlled / impacted by lymph
		lymph is 3/4 interstitial fluid
			Interstitial fluid (ISF) or tissue fluid is a solution that bathes and surrounds the tissue cells of multicellular animals. It is the main component of the extracellular fluid, which also includes plasma and transcellular fluid. The interstitial fluid is found in the interstices[1] - the spaces between cells (also known as the tissue spaces). On average, a person has about 10 litres (2.2 imperial gallons or ~2.4 US gal) of interstitial fluid (making up 16% of the total body weight), providing the cells of the body with nutrients and a means of waste removal.
	lymph has to remove damaged tissue, take cells to lymph nodes for macrophage food + at same time heal that tissue
	problem: bodies become acid, adrenals/neurotransmitters low because steroids, parathyroid down, low calcium utilization = no1 heals well
	solution: be @ high fruit/berry/melon level

Strengthen nervous system
100% raw, no cooked food: Fruits Berries Melons + Herbs (upper circ / brain nerve (#1 & #2)
can't regenerate on greens / veggie diet
Move Lymph
Adrenal glands control kidneys which filter out acids/toxins produced by cells
